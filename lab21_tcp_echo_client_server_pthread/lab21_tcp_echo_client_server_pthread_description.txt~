When we use fork() to allow multiple client connection it becomes havier task to manage memory for a client as separate instance of a server is made without having any concern of resources.An ideal solution to this is the use of pthread where a thread which is light weight resourse is created to deal with the client request.It will handle request and also acquires less resources as compared to fork().
